<h2 id="aboutme"> About Me</h2>

<p>


	My name is Maryam Ahmad and I am a senior at <a href="https://www.babson.edu/"> Babson College</a>. I am currently 21 years old, but I am turning 22 on
	March 30th. I came to Babson College because I come from a family of entrepreneurs, and I was hoping to be able to
	one day become one myself. I was inclined to go to Babson because I also saw that most alumni who decided to not
	pursue entrepreneurship, worked at reputable firms. I am a finance concentration, and now as a senior I am thankful
	for all the networking opportunities I have been given due to being a Babson student.

	My favorite thing to do is shop! I love going shopping with my friends! My favorite place to go shopping is Soho,
	Manhattan. I grew up going shopping there with my mom almost every weekend, they have all the best stores from high
	end luxury to stores like Aritzia and Zara. I love buying clothing, shoes, and accessories because I love wearing
	new outfits. I believe that the way you dress has a huge impact on how your day is going to go. Therefore, I always
	try to wear an outfit that makes me feel good!
