	<h3>Homework 3</h3>
	<p id="desc">
		The form given below has 3 fields. Let us assume that the user will type in the name of one of 3 products: Milk,
		Apple, or Fish. The user may enter these using any mix of cases, so be aware. You need to check to ensure that
		the user enters a value. If it is not one of these 3, let the user know. Then the user will enter a quantity.
		You need to check to ensure that a quantity is entered (you may assume that 0 is a valid quantity) and that the
		value is numeric. Once validated, use the following costs - 1 bottle of milk is $3.50; one apple is $0.99 and
		one pound of fish is $5.99 - and show the amount owed in the third field. All of this should be done when the
		appropriate button is pressed. The amount must be shown with 2 decimal places and prefixed with a $ (dollar)
		sign.
	</p>

	<form id="productForm">
		<p>
			<input type="text" name="product" size="20" placeholder="Enter product..." />
			&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
			<input type="text" name="quantity" size="20" placeholder="Enter quantity.." />
		</p>
		<p>
			<input type="text" name="AmtDue" size="20" placeholder="show amount due" readonly />
		</p>
		<p>
			<button type="button" class="but" onclick="calculateAmount()">What Do I Owe</button>
			&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
			<input type="reset" class="but" value="Clear All" />
		</p>
	</form>

	<script>
		function calculateAmount() {
			var form = document.getElementById('productForm');
			var product = form.product.value.toLowerCase();
			var quantity = parseFloat(form.quantity.value);
			var amountDueField = form.AmtDue;

			if (!product || (product !== 'milk' && product !== 'apple' && product !== 'fish')) {
				alert('Please enter a valid product: Milk, Apple, or Fish.');
				return;
			}

			if (isNaN(quantity) || quantity < 0) {
				alert('Please enter a valid numeric quantity that is 0 or greater.');
				return;
			}

			var prices = { 'milk': 3.50, 'apple': 0.99, 'fish': 5.99 };
			var price = prices[product];
			var amountDue = (price * quantity).toFixed(2);
			amountDueField.value = `$${amountDue}`;

		}

	<h2>ChatGPT description</h2>
	<p>

		I used five iterations to get the text to work. These are the questions I asked,”can you fix this code to answer
		the question.””Please fix this code to answer the prompt” Lastly, I asked,”Can you please fix this quote to
		answer the assignment question.” I then asked.” Do I have to define price per unit.” With a follow up question
		of,”Why does my code not calculate the amount and instead only sends me an alert.” It was a combination of
		constantly inputting the same code into ChatGPT 3.5 to be able to see all the different versions it has as an
		output. When we spoke in office hours, you said it was fine that I did not understand everything that was going
		on in the ChatGPT code. However, I will try and explain what I do understand. I understand that using the
		toLowerCase allows for even if there is a mix of cases it will all be lowercase, which unifies everything. This
		is used for product because in this one we are working with words not numbers like quantity. I understand that
		parseFloat is used here for calculations, to make sure they are actual numbers. I essentially understand most,
		because as I told you in office hours I did a lot of research on google and other things. However, I do not
		understand this var price = prices[product];.
		Maybe you can explain what that means. The calculations and putting it to 2 decimal points are clear, as well as
		how to implement the dollar signs as well. I think it wasn’t terribly off. I do think however, it took me more
		tries than I thought because I need to ask more specific questions next time. I think the comparison is not too off.
