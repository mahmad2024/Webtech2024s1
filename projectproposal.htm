			The objective of this website would be to demonstrate the design of a website that will be a college girl "style guide"
			utilizing
			my own personal closet. I take pride in all of the outfits I put together in the morning, and would love to
			give
			other college students some outfit inspiration. This website would serve the purpose of allowing users to be
			able to find clothing, shoes, or accessories they like and add it to their own closet. This demonstrating
			will
			 implement three different scenarios in which you may need to find an outfit, and two examples via photos per
			scenario. I believe feeling confident is the key to being the most successful version of yourself!

				The target audience of this website is college girls who need daily outfit inspiration. This
				website may peak the interest of an incoming freshman, as she may be confused on what to wear to class,
				to a social gathering, or to lounge with her friends. This style guide also has the potential to attract
				a girl who is already in college, who is going through an outfit inspiration rutt and wants to gain some
				fresh ideas. It may also serve as a guide for any girl in college who needs to find comfortable ways to look cute.

				Along with the required pages of the project, my website will include pictures I have taken of myself
				wearing outfits that are meant to be sources of inspiration. I will make sure to include information on
				each article of clothing, the accessories, and footwear I am wearing in each photo.
				I will also put each photo in seperate categorized tabs,  which will include an outfit for
				class, going out with friends, or a lazy study day in the library. I will have a seperate tab for stores to shop at that are budget friendly or  for some good designer statement pieces.  I will also include a tab in which
				there will be a collection of,"must haves" for each of these categories. These will essentially be items that I always carry in my purse when I am in any of these scenarios.
