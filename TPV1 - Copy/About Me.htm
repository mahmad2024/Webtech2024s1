    <h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<!-- Your HTML goes here -->
	<p>My name is Maryam Ahmad, and I am a senior at Babson College. I am a finance concentration, with a love for the
		arts. I am from Howard Beach, New York City. Ever since I was young I have always loved clothing and fashion. I
		love the way a good outfit can make someone feel, and how certain colors and patterns compliment a person’s
		body. Fashion is what makes the world vibrate, as you look around and everyone’s personality is transparent from
		the clothing they wear. The outfits people wear can also be a reflection of their mood. All of these aspects of
		fashion are the reasons that it is not only my hobby, but my passion. I studied abroad in Milan, the fashion
		capital of the world, and could not have been more thankful for the opportunity to learn alongside some of the
		most talented fashion professors. I hope you enjoy this website, as it is a project I am very proud to share
		with everyone!
